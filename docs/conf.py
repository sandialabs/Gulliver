# Configuration file for the Sphinx documentation builder.
#
# This file only contains a selection of the most common options. For a full
# list see the documentation:
# https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html

# -- Path setup --------------------------------------------------------------

# If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in another directory,
# add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is relative to the
# documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.
#
# import os
# import sys
# sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('.'))


# -- Project information -----------------------------------------------------

# -- General configuration ---------------------------------------------------

# Add any Sphinx extension module names here, as strings. They can be
# extensions coming with Sphinx (named 'sphinx.ext.*') or your custom
# ones.
extensions = []

# Add any paths that contain templates here, relative to this directory.

# List of patterns, relative to source directory, that match files and
# directories to ignore when looking for source files.
# This pattern also affects html_static_path and html_extra_path.

# -- Options for HTML output -------------------------------------------------

# The name of the Pygments (syntax highlighting) style to use.
pygments_style = 'sphinx'

# The theme to use for HTML and HTML Help pages.  See the documentation for
# a list of builtin themes.

# Add any paths that contain custom static files (such as style sheets) here,
# relative to this directory. They are copied after the builtin static files,
# so a file named "default.css" will overwrite the builtin "default.css".
html_static_path = ['_static']

# If true, Sphinx will warn about all references where the target cannot be
# found. Default is False. You can activate this mode temporarily using the
# - n command-line switch.
nitpicky = True

# A list of(type, target) tuples(by default empty) that should be ignored
# when generating warnings in “nitpicky mode”. Note that type should include
# the domain name if present. Example entries would be('py:func', 'int') or
# ('envvar', 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH').
