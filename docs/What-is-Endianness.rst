What is Endianness
##################

Endianness [#Endianness]_, at least as far as computing is concerned, is the ordering of bytes within a binary representation of data. The most common representations of endianness are :ref:`big-endian` and :ref:`little-endian`. There exist other forms, such as Middle-Endian, but those are beyond the scope of this document.

**********

The Computer Science terms Big-Endian and Little-Endian were introduced by Danny Cohen [#CohenDanny]_ in 1980. The key term *endian* has its roots in the novel Gulliverâ€™s Travels [#GulliversTravels]_ by Jonathan Swift [#SwiftJonathan]_ where within a war occurs between two factions who are fighting over which end of a boiled egg should be opened for eating. The big end or the little end. Unsurprisingly, the same said book was the inspiration for the naming of the `Gulliver <https://github.com/sandialabs/gulliver>`_ library.

Big-Endian
**********

Big-Endian, often referred to as *Network Byte Order*, ordering is left-to-right. Given the representation of an unsigned number in bytes the further to the left that a byte exists the more significant it is.

For example, the decimal value of the unsigned integer ``6060842`` may be represented as ``0x5C7B2A`` in hexadecimal. This hexadecimal value is composed of the three bytes ``0x5C``, ``0x7B``, and ``0x28``. As such the value ``6060842`` may be represented in Big-Endian as a byte stream of ``[0x5C, 0x7B, 0x2A]``.

Big-Endian integer representation likely comes as second nature to developers familiar with right-to-left Arabic numerals [#ArabicNumerals]_ representation.

.. _little-endian:

Little-Endian
*************

Little-Endian ordering is right-to-left. Given the representation of an unsigned number in bytes the further to the right a byte exists the more significant it is.

For example, the decimal value of the unsigned integer ``8675309`` may be represented as ``0x85BF7D`` in hexadecimal. This hexadecimal value is composed of the three bytes ``0x85``, ``0xBF``, and ``0x7D``. As such the value ``8675309`` may be represented in Little-Endian as a byte stream of ``[0x7D, 0xBFm 0x85]``.

To developers most affiliated with right-to-left natural languages Little-Endian may seem backwards.
