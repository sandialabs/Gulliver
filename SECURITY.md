# Reporting Security Issues

The Gulliver team takes security issues in Gulliver and our other projects seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose security related findings.

 **Please do not file an issue via the issue tracker**, we'd prefer to avoid publishing security issue details until after we have a fix in place. This will aid in avoiding vulnerability exploitation in the wild.

We request that if you discover a security significant issue in our library that you report it via email to us at [opensource@sandia.gov](mailto:opensource@sandia.gov). Please include the words "[GULLIVER SECURITY]" in the subject line. Upon notification of a security issue we may request additional information.

The Gulliver team will do our best alleviate the issue and inform the public as appropriate.
